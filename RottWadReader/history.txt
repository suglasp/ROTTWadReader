"ROTT2D WAD Reader" project started on 09-01-2012
                     ->  Last updated: 24-06-2012

project by Pieter De Ridder
web: www.rott2d.net

v1a : - gui design for Rott2DWADReader
      - created class created

v1b : - Rott2DPalette + Rott2DGeneral created

v1c : - Rott2DWADLabels + Rott2DLump created

v1d : - Rott2DSky + Rott2DFlat + Rott2DPatch created

v1e : - Rott2DMasked created
      - problems with Rott2DMasked generateLumpData() method
        Bitconverter.UInt16 not working

v1h:  - Rott2DVOC, Rott2DUnknown, Rott2DMidi

v1g : - Finished Rott2DMasked and create new classes Rott2DASCII, Rott2DMarker, Rott2DMarkerConroller

v1i : - Rott2DTransMasked created and Finish Rott2DMarkerConroller

v1j : - Further implemented decoding of texture structures.

v1k : - Found in lumpy.h (rott source) other struct types.
        Some textures are recognized as "unknown" -> new pic_t format?
       
	    One of this is the very simple struct:
		typedef struct
		{
		   byte     width,height;
		   byte     data;
		} pic_t;
		
      I suspect some textures like key images and other small textures use this format!

v1l: - Added Rott2DPic class for small textures + updated a compare function

v1m - v1u: - Rott2DPic works for images with a width of 8xn.
v1z: - Rott2DPic finally works fully

v2a: - fixed in wave output the small "crack". Offset in rawdata was incorrect because
       didn't count the header size in raw copy to output.


v2b: - Added Rott2DWave, own wave output class
	 - Added Rott2DSimplePCspeakerPlayer class (maybe for future pc speaker support?) 
     - Added checking for correct auto detect data type recognition
	 - Found bug in transmasked class => not all textures are loaded?

v2c - v2e: - Problem with transmasked textures. Depends on type of transmasked texture.
			 First in a row reads perfect. For others i have to add a byte read offset?

v2f: - fixed a few incorrect recognized lumps in controller
     - found bug: when to fast scrolling in list -> bitmap goed out of memory and picture box shows a cross

v2g: - fixed gunstart marker
     - tested wad file from shareware v1.0 (default provided is shareware v1.3)

v2h: - optimized some routines to recognize Flat, Sky & Palette
     - added reading from Birger's comment (winrottgl code -> export PCX file).

v2i  - v2j: (06-02-2012) - finally fixed the transmasked textures!

v2k: - Added code for alpha value in Palette to result in darkness

v2l: - Improved and optimized lot of the code, also added Rott2DFastBitmap & Rott2DFastBitmap.SetFill
     - Changed values in is(Trans-)Masked textures from up to 4096 to 2048 in size in Rott2DMarkerController
	 - Fixed reading of wall45 texture

v2m: - Optimized wave class

v2n: - tried AP_PAL palette lump -> works

v2o: - rewritten parts of copy/pasted doombuilder code for testing the loop of the (large) masked textures
           --> result te same

v2p: - after some searching and raw dumping of the large read masked textures, found out that
       iXpos was defined as byte instead of ushort or int. So the loop was "stuck" on the end of row 255,
	   and even never throw an error in a try-catch.
	 - fixed also Rott2DPic size of images. Header of a pic defines width and height as byte. But changed
	    this to ushort. Reason was for loading the "MMBK" image lump.

v2q,r,s,t,u: - updated some stuff. Found out in version v2t that lbm format != patch format.

v2v: - restructure of the Rott2DMarkerController.isxxxx() methods, to it's own "parent" classes.

v2x: - problems with restructured (pic_t) Rott2DPic.isPicTexture() method. These are solved.
     - Also fixed loading of pic_t's of max 320. (bounds where set to 64*4, increased to 80*4).
	 - Updated lbm format checking. I still need to finish the algorithm of lbm.
	 - Still Need to find out LED1 en LED2 lumps.

v2y: - fixed LED1 and LED2 lump loading (masked minimal texture size was 10, is now 3. Dis same for transmasked).
     - added in-between class for loading RAW textures and changed inheritance for Rott2DSky and Rott2DFlat.
	 - changed palette short values to ushort values.
	 - further research for lbm format in ROTT wad lump's.

v2z: - after long debugging of the AP_WRLD, PLANE and the TRILOGO texture lumps,
       i found out that these are actually patch_t textures.
	   So removed lbm code class again and changes Rott2DPatch class to support loading of larger textures
	   up to 320x200 pix.
	 - some lumps in darkwar.wad are recognized as transmasked lumps. Namely lumps in range "MASKED3" -> "MASKED39".
	   "MASKED3A" does read as a transmasked.
	 - updated some short var values to ushort.

v3a: - Fixed bug with darkwar.wad lumps in range "MASKED3" -> "MASKED39" that where recognized as masked instead of transmasked.
     - Added support for colormaps, not readlly finished yet.
     - New bug: Some smaller lumps are now recognized as transmasked

v3b: - Finished colormaps.
     - Fixed bug where some smaller lumps are recognized as transmasked instead of masked
	 - Updated the voc file class a bit more (block parsing methods)
	 - Made Rott2DLumpWriter disposable
	 - On the end of parsing a lump from GUI list, disposed the palette var

v3c: - Fixed loading of palette (pal was disposed at the end of reading the list).
       So in order to show the palette in the output, i needed to Clone the actual bitmap.
	 - Improved some stuff on the colormap.

v3d: - Moved all data to dll's. Still needs to be imported.

v3e: - Conversion to dll's completed.

v3f: - Public release version.

v3g: - Same as v3f, but cleaned up a bit.

v3h-j: - Minor fixes in code

v3k: - (2013) fixed wad file close, when error on reading header data


Info on ROTT v1.3 wad files lump count:
Huntbegins wad file lump count: 2091
Darkwar    wad file lump count: 3892



todo:
[fixed] fastbitmap? + struct properties en pointers => werkt PixelData data->A?
[fixed] "bbarrel", "sdoor4a" -> herkend als flat ipv masked
[fixed] "edoorh" -> herkend as palette ipv masked
[?    ] when to fast scrolling in list -> bitmap goes out of memory and application crashes
[fixed] optimize wave memory build routine (Rott2DWave)
[fixed] wall45 gives error? -> marked as Masked
[fixed] application hang on large masked format textures 
[fixed] led1 and led2 lumps do not load
[fixed] screen1 does not load
[fixed] move all isxxxx() methods from controller to "parent" classes
[fixed] create in-between class for sky and flat --> "raw" format
[skip ] finish reading body of a lbm lump
[fixed] darkwar.wad lumps in range "MASKED3" -> "MASKED39" are recognized as masked
[fixed] Some smaller lumps are now recognized as transmasked
